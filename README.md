## Reflection

One key difference between relational databases and document databases is schema flexibility. Relational databases require predefined schemas and store data in tables, while MongoDB uses JSON-like documents that allow dynamic fields, making it easier to handle evolving data structures. Another difference is scalability—MongoDB supports horizontal scaling and sharding more naturally than traditional SQL systems.

## Differences Between Relational and Non-Relational Databases

Relational databases, such as **MySQL**, and non-relational databases, like **MongoDB**, differ in their schema flexibility and data organization. MySQL uses a fixed schema, so it is less flexible when changes are needed. In contrast, MongoDB uses a dynamic, document-based structure. **MySQL** stores data in tables and connects related information using joins, while **MongoDB** often keeps related data together in a single document. This makes MongoDB more effective at handling changes and diverse types of data. Because of this, **MongoDB** works well for applications where data needs often change.

### Healthcare Scenario
For example, in healthcare, MongoDB is a good choice for **remote patient monitoring**. Devices like **glucose monitors** create semi-structured, time-series data that can vary by device. MongoDB’s flexible schema and ability to manage large amounts of sensor data make it a strong option for storing and analyzing this information in real time.
