## Reflection

One key difference between relational databases and document databases is schema flexibility. Relational databases require predefined schemas and store data in tables, while MongoDB uses JSON-like documents that allow dynamic fields, making it easier to handle evolving data structures. Another difference is scalability—MongoDB supports horizontal scaling and sharding more naturally than traditional SQL systems.

In healthcare, MongoDB is ideal for storing patient-generated health data from wearable devices or IoT sensors because:

* This data is often semi-structured and varies widely between patients, making rigid schemas impractical.
* MongoDB’s document model stores data as flexible JSON-like documents, allowing dynamic fields and evolving data structures without costly schema migrations.
* The flexible schema supports rapid ingestion of diverse data types and formats generated by different devices and sensors.
* MongoDB’s scalability and sharding capabilities enable handling large volumes of continuous data streams efficiently.
* Real-time analytics and querying are facilitated by MongoDB’s indexing and aggregation framework, supporting timely clinical decision-making.
* The document model aligns well with personalized healthcare needs, where patient data is unique and heterogeneous.
* MongoDB’s support for secure data storage and compliance features helps protect sensitive health information.

This combination of flexibility, scalability, and real-time processing makes MongoDB well-suited for managing complex, variable patient-generated health data in modern healthcare environments.
